Hi, I'm Wenshan

I'm a PhD researcher at Paul-Drude-Institute for Solid State Electronics in Berlin, where I work on ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor thin films using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).  

My research focuses on understanding the growth kinetics and thermodynamics of oxide materials like GeO₂ and (SnₓGe₁₋ₓ)O₂, aiming to advance next-generation power electronic materials.

Alongside my research, I've developed a growing interest in programming, and I am passionate about data automation, FAIR data principles, and how to make research data AI-ready. I like building small but useful tools that help bridge the gap between the lab and structured, machine-readable data formats.

Here is an example of my project: [datwatch]([https://github.com/YourUsername/datwatch](https://github.com/WenshanChen-3/lab-data-automation.git))

[datwatch] is a small project I wrote while contributing to the integration of  "FAIRmat/NOMAD" as a data management tool in our research institute.  It's a lightweight Python tool that automates the conversion of instrument-generated data into AI-ready, FAIR-compliant formats.


💡 What I'm interested in:
- Data-driven materials science and automation  
- FAIR and reproducible research workflows  
- Machine learning and data management in materials discovery  
- Scientific Python for data handling and visualization

I enjoy building practical tools that make research smoother and ready for the next step — whether that's AI, data sharing, or simply better collaboration.
